11.explain when it is suitable to use the following repetition control structure : 
(a)for loop  
(B)while loop 
(c)do while loop 
A)For loop -it is suitable to use for loop repetition control structure when you know the exact number of times you want to repeat a certain block of code  which provides an organized way to iterate over a range of values or elements.
B)while loop -is suitable when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. 
C)do while loop-is suitable When you need to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they provide valid data as This ensures that the code inside the loop executes at least once, allowing for immediate feedback or error messages before re-prompting for input.
2.explain the diff between while loop and do while loop 
The main difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that the do-while loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition, while the while loop checks the condition first before executing the code.

3.write a java program that ask user to guess a number between 0 and 20 then the program generates the number and if the number entered by the user matches the number generated by the program the program displays the text you have won or else the program should give user another chance for the user to guess number for the second time up to the fifth time.

the code



public class Guessing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int numberToGuess = 15, maxAttempts = 5, attempts = 0;
//to generate a number between 0-20
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nTry to guess the number between 0 and 20.");

        while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            int userGuess = scanner.nextInt();

            if (userGuess == numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You have won!");
                break; //to stop if it is successful
            } else {
                System.out.println("Incorrect guess. Try again.");

                if (++attempts < maxAttempts) {
                    System.out.println("You have " + (maxAttempts - attempts) + " attempts remaining.\n");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Sorry, you've run out of attempts. The correct number was: " + numberToGuess);
                }
            }
        }

        
    }
